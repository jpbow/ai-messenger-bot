# Facebook Messenger bot with wit.ai integration
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/42c2df2d04664433b100a82e81bca3f0)](https://www.codacy.com/app/jpbowley/ai-messenger-bot?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=jpbow/ai-messenger-bot&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Follow this tutorial to get the bot up and running in less than half an hour!

In this tutorial we deploy the NodeJS server directly to Heroku, but it can be run locally by using ngrok so the Facebook Messenger platform can reach you. Documentation on this will be available at a later time.

## You'll need the following before we begin
* A Messenger platform setup (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart)
* A wit.ai account
* A Heroku account

## Quickstart

Coming soon! Should have this finished in the next week.

## Sources
* Makes use of code from the official wit.ai messenger.js example (https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit)
* This guide loosely follows the 15 minute Facebook bot guide by (https://github.com/jw84/messenger-bot-tutorial)
